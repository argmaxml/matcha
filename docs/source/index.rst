The recsplain system
=====================

The recsplain system is a recommendation engine that uses AI to compare and recommend items based on feature similarity between the items.

Recommendations that increase conversions
-----------------------------------------------

Use the system to compare and recommend items.

Use the system to search by item to find similar items in your database based on item features.

Use the system to recommend items to users based on how items compare to a user's purchase history.

.. note::
   One common application of recsplain is in online stores. The recsplain system helps online stores recommend products to customers based on items the customer already bought from the store.  The recommendation system, however, is not limited to just online stores. The applications are virtually endless. 

Create your own
------------------

Use recsplain to create your very own recommendation engine.

It is easy to install and to customize to suit your needs.

Configure the system to make recommendations based on your needs by using: 

- filters to categorically exclude data from the recommendations
- encoders to dictate how the system checks whether items are similar

After you configure the system, you can easily index a list of items from your database so that you can start making recommendations.

Make recommendations
-------------------------

Start making recommendations.

Make recommendations by item or by user. Use the recsplain system for:

- searching by item to get other items most similar to it 
- searching by user to get items the user most likely prefers based on the user's order history

Use explanations
-----------------------

The recsplain system explains it recommendations so that you can better understand its recommendations.
