recsplain
==============

Good recommendations are critical for increasing conversions. 

The recsplain system helps you increase conversions by using AI to recommend items based on feature similarity between the items.

The system finds items that are similar to a specific item and recommends items to users based on their purchase history of the items.

One common application of recsplain is in online stores. The recsplain system helps online stores recommend products to customers based on items the customer already bought from the store.

The recommendation system, however, is not limited to just online stores. For instance, the recsplain system also helps recruiters match job openings to job applicants.

The applications are virtually endless.

Use recsplain to create your very own recommendation engine.

It is easy to install and to customize to suit your needs.

Configure the system to make recommendations based on your needs by using: 

- filters to categorically exclude data from the recommendations
- encoders to dictate how the system checks whether items are similar

After you configure the system, you can easily index a list of items from your database so that you can start making recommendations.

You can start making recommendations by:

- searching by item to get other items most similar to it 
- searching by user to get items the user most likely prefers based on the user's order history

Each time you search, you also have the option to receive explanations from the recsplain system about why it recommended the items.
