Recsplain System ü¶ñ 
==========================================

The Recsplain System makes recommendations and explains them. 

Install it in your app, use it with your data, and customize it how you want.

Explainable Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example recommendation with explanations. 

The example query is for items in the US that are low in price and in the meat category. 

You can see it in the image below. It looks like this.

.. literalinclude:: item_query_example.py
  :language: python

.. image:: images/explanations.png

The Response body in the image above contains the recommendations and explanations.

The recommendations are in the ids array. The ids are ordered by index position from most to least recommended. The lowest index position is the most recommended.

The explanations are in the distance and explanations arrays.

The values in those arrays correspond to the values in the ids array by index position.

How It Works 
---------------------------------------------------------

Recsplain turns items into weighted feature vectors.

The the system compares feature vectors to one another to calculate how similar they are.

Recsplain can compare feature vectors using different encoders.
