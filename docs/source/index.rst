Recsplain System ðŸ¦– 
==========================================

The Recsplain System makes recommendations and explains them. 

It can recommend items based on:

- Item similarity 
- User preferences 

Install it in your app, use it with your data, and customize it how you want.

Explainable Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example recommendation with explanations for an item similarity search. 

The example query is for items in the US that are in the meat category and also low in price. 

You can see the request and response in the image below. 

.. image:: images/explanations.png

The response body in the image above contains the recommendations and explanations.

The recommendations are in the ids array. The ids are ordered by index position from most to least recommended. The lowest index position is the most recommended.

The explanations are in the distance and explanations arrays. The values in those arrays correspond to the values in the ids array by index position.

The distances explain item similarity based on all features and weights. To supplement the distances, the explanations provide more granularity by giving you similarity values for each feature. This way you can have a deeper understanding of the overall distances and recommendations.

How It Works 
---------------------------------------------------------

For item similarity, Recsplain turns the items into weighted feature vectors.

The system compares the item feature vectors to one another to calculate how similar they are.

For user preferences, Recsplain turns the user into an item feature vector based on the user's previous history with the items.

The system compares the user feature vector to the item features vectors to calculate how similar the items are those the items in the user's history.

Field Types & Schema
---------------------------------------------------------

Configure Recsplain to compare feature vectors using your preferred filters and encoders. 

Filters determine which items are compared to one another and encoders determine how they are compared. 

Here is an example configuration.

.. literalinclude:: init_schema_example.py
  :language: python
	
1. Filter Fields

The filter fields are hard filters. They separate items into different partitions. Only items within the same partition are compared to one another.
 
The example above creates two partitions. One for US items and another for EU.

2. Encoder Fields

The encoder fields are soft filters for fuzzy matching. They determine how item features are compared within a partition.

The example above selects the one-hot encoder for each of item feature, price and catgory.

3. User Encoders

When recommending items for a user, Recsplain has special encoders you should use.
